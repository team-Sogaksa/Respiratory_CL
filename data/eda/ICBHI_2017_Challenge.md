# Respiratory Sound Database Overview
---

https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/

The Respiratory Sound database was originally compiled to support the scientific challenge organized at Int. Conf. on Biomedical Health Informatics - ICBHI 2017. The current version of this database is made freely available for research and contains both the public and the private dataset of the ICBHI challenge.

The Respiratory Sound Database contains **audio samples**, collected independently by two research teams in **two different countries**, over several years. Most of the database consists of audio samples recorded by :

- the School of Health Sciences, University of Aveiro (ESSUA) research team at the Respiratory Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory (Lab3R), ESSUA and at Hospital Infante D. Pedro, Aveiro, Portugal. The second research team, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)

- and the University of Coimbra (UC), acquired respiratory sounds at the Papanikolaou General Hospital, Thessaloniki and at the General Hospital of Imathia (Health Unit of Naousa), Greece.

The database consists of a **total of 5.5 hours of recordings** containing **6898 respiratory cycles**, of which
- **1864 contain crackles**,
- **886 contain wheezes**, and
- **506 contain both crackles and wheezes**,

in **920 annotated audio samples from 126 subjects**.

The cycles were annotated by respiratory experts as including crackles, wheezes, a combination of them, or no adventitious respiratory sounds. The recordings were
- collected using **heterogeneous equipment**
- and their duration ranged from **10s to 90s**.

The **chest locations** from which the recordings were acquired is also provided. Noise levels in some respiration cycles is high, which simulate real life conditions.
